## NontonNyaman : Comfortable Wathcing
Our app is dedicated to providing a seamless and comfortable experience for mobility-challenged individuals to enjoy offline sporting events. There are some features which are venue accessibility, easy-to-use but really informative homepage, and customer assistance. 

## List of NontonNyaman Feature

By utilising the venue accesibility, it will be expected to have a clearer way of understanding the venue, such as the most ideal path to go to the rest areas, restroom facilities, etc. The features are, Stadium Map, List of Stadium Features, and Navigation.

Also, by implementing the customer homepage, it will show some informative information in the context of the events that are currently available in the selected stadium. There are some features that is included in this session, such as News Events Updates, Accommodation Suggestion, and also Accessible seating information.

Then we determine that the majority of the customers will require assistance based on the brief we received. In order to meet those needs, we are considering establishing connections between individuals by asking staff members to accompany customers, ease their fear, and heighten their joy as they watch the Olympic Games. Included in this are the menu items for Food and Beverages, Require Staff Assistance, and Emergency Assistance.
